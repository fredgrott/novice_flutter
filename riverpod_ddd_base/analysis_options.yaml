# This file configures the analyzer, which statically analyzes Dart code to
# check for errors, warnings, and lints.
#
# The issues identified by the analyzer are surfaced in the UI of Dart-enabled
# IDEs (https://dart.dev/tools#ides-and-editors). The analyzer can also be
# invoked from the command line by running `flutter analyze`.

# The following line activates a set of recommended lints for Flutter apps,
# packages, and plugins designed to encourage good coding practices.
include: package:lint/analysis_options.yaml

# I use specialize analyzer settings to assist in having a 
# fine-tuned developer feedback concerning types 
# beyond the recommendations as I have found that it saves 
# developer time when migrating to the dart major version 
# versions.
