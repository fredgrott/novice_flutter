# Novice Flutter

Doing this a bit different. Not the stuff in the Flutter Docs, but the missing stuff that no one is telling you about. Like:

- How to extend ThemeData

- How to Share Scaffolds in the adaptive nav pattern

- How to really glue the jumble of state solution parts so it 
becomes one coordinated full state management solution.

- How to implement full acceptance driven development testing along with behavior driven development within the same exact test setup.

- Adaptive and Responsive Layouts for all screens

But, first I need the code demos. Hence a repo with small code demos that become the center of book chapters.

## Biases

- Domain Driven Design based

- Widget Dependency Injection as it's saving grace despite being 
  putting compile time dependency errors in run-time error buckets is integrated with dev-tools to give enough debug tools during debug testing to make up for that antipattern of confining dependency errors to the run-time bucket.

- BLoC

- Proper logging via actually understanding why log infrastructure should be using the streaming to support real performative application logging in real-time.

- Infusion of Functional Programming to switch from imperative to more composable code both in the business-logic layer, domain layer, and the presentation layers
